It was a chilly evening in Philedephia.
Robin is seen flipping through channels in her one bedroom apartment.
Next to her is a 11 rack of Budweiser and the pals of meloons. 
She hears a knock on the door. 
why is there a merge conflict???
Roben assumes its her annoying neighbor who is tell her to turn down the TV volume.
Usually she ignores the hard knocks.
However suddenly the door breaks down and a mysterious figure rushes in.
Robin is shocked, but she grabs the melon baller next to her and lunges forward at the shadows.
Since she is very drunk she does not remember what happens next but awakes next to a dead man. 
His eyeballs are gouged out by the melon baller in her hand.
In a panic, Robin packs her headbag along with her passpart and car keys.
On the way out she notices the dead man is wearing a familiar ring on his left hand.
It is her late husband's wedding ring. 
She takes the ring and takes her Toyota corolla westwards.
