It was a chilly evening in Philadephia.
Robin is seen flipping through channels in her one bedroom apartment.
Next to her is a 12 rack of Budweisers and the peels of melons. 
She hears a knock on her door. 
Robin assume its her annoying neighbor who is telling her to turn down the TV volume.
Usually she ignores the knocks.
However suddenly the door breaks down and a mysterious figure rushes in.
Robin is shocked, but she grabs the melon baller next to her and lunges forward at the shadows.
Since she is very drunk she does not remember what happens next but awakes next to a dead man. 
His eyeballs are gouged out by the melon baller in her hand.
In a panic, Robin packs her handbag along with her passport and car keys.
On the way out she notices the dead man is wearing a familiar ring on his left hand.
It is her late husband's wedding band. 
She takes the ring and takes her Toyota Avalon westwards.
