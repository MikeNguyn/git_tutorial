The husband appeared out of no where, in the bathroom, as the widow demon is filled with rage, close to killing Matt, the man who has trapped her husband in the basement for the past 12 years. She is 12 feet tall
"Dana!" he babbled, "you're... you're here"
"Charles! Is that Charles? My dear Charles", she said as her anger withers, and she slowly transformed back to her human form. "Thank god you are still alive"
Dana rushed to her husband, giving him a tight hug, so tight that it might kill him the second time... or the first time depending on how you think about it.
"It's time to go home, Charles", Dana said
"I don't think so my dear", Charles mumbled, while Dana stood still. "You see, Matt and I, we are married now", he told her, while helping Matt stand up.
Not letting her husband respond anymore, she killed them both, and leave the castle, tears filled with the smell of death
