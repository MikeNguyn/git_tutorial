One day the Cutting Widow wandered onto a huckleberry farm.
Curious as to whether the farmers knew anything about her husband's killers she floated into the house and took a peek inside. 
The house was occupied by an old man that was chewing tobacco and his wife who was cooking pie.
"Hello?" the Cutting Widow asked the startled pair, "Could you help me?"
"WTF!" the farmers screamed.
The wife acted fast, throwing her huckleberry pie straight at the Cutting Widows' head.
The husband was a bit slower, spitting out his tabacco and grabbing a nearby broom.
"What do you want?"
Covered in huckleberry filling, Widow was blunt, "I'm looking for the killers of my dead husband. Have you seen anyone weird pass through?"
"No.", said the wife.
"Try England" said the husband.
"Some people just won't help anybody" Widow thought to herself. 
She floated out of the house and back down to the road.
"Maybe i should try England."
